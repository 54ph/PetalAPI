!!! IMPORTANT !!!

PetalAPI is very experimental and is NOT stable as of now.

Don't flood GitHub's issue tracker with the following issues:
- Bricked installations (I recommend to make a restore point before installing)
- Lack of Windows Server 2003 and XP x64 support
- "This project sucks" instead of proper criticism

Thank you for reading.
